                          I am delighted to learn of the release of the annual
                          magazine  of  the  Literary  Club  of  Puducherry
                          Technological University. I offer my congratulations
                          to everyone involved in producing this publication,
                          as  it  provides  a  valuable  platform  for  students  to
                          express  their  views  on  a  variety  of  issues  of
                          importance. In today’s world, discussions on issues
                          plaguing  the  world,  like  climate  change,  diversity
                          and  equity  initiatives,  the  meteoric  advances  in

                          Artificial Intelligence and many others are the need
                          of the hour.


                          The  Literary  Club  has  been  an  enigmatic  entity,
                          encouraging  students  to  discuss  and  ponder,
                          challenging  students  to  think  of  solutions  to
                          society's  challenges  and  fostering  spirited  debate
                          and inclusive dialogue. The conduct of events at the
                          University  level  enables  students  from  different
                          disciplines  of  Engineering  and  Humanities  to
                          engage  in  the  exchange  of  views  on  inter-
                          disciplinary  issues  and  challenges.  I  send  my
                          sincere greetings to the team behind "Expressions"
                          and  the  Literary  Club  for  their  role  in  fostering  an

                          environment where civil discussions are encouraged
                          and solutions are forged on common ground.


                          A  special  appreciation  to  Prof.  Dr.  Shanthi  Simon,
                          who  has  spear  headed  the  literary  club  of
                          Puducherry  Technological  University  in  a  very
                          effective  way  and  involving  many  students  to  take
                          part in the literary club activities.

                        Puducherry  Technological  University  has  always

                        been  proud  of  its  efforts  to  inspire  students  to
                        effect  meaningful  change.  I  am  pleased  to
                        acknowledge  the  tireless  efforts  of  the  Literary
                        Club,  which  has  consistently  engaged  students,
                        offering  them  a  platform  to  express  their  views

                        and ideas. The magazine "Expressions" serves as a
                        conduit  for  the  thoughts  and  opinions  of  the
                        students.  The  Literary  Club’s  diligent  team  takes

                        it  upon  themselves  every  year  to  ensure  that  the
                        students  have  a  platform  to  question,  ponder,
                        debate  and  discuss.  With  new  initiatives  every
                        year,  I  have  observed  the  Literary  Club  operate
                        with  unmatched  vigour  since  its  inception,

                        fostering  lively  discussions  and  an  expression  of
                        intellectual  ability  that  is  crucial  to  a  student’s
                        holistic  development.  I  offer  my  wholehearted

                        support to their endeavour. I extend my heartfelt
                        congratulations  to  the  students  and  alumni  who
                        have  contributed  to  this  latest  edition  of
                        Expressions,  and  I  applaud  the  team  behind  the
                        magazine’s  release.  The  students  stand  to  gain

                        much  from  the  Literary  Club’s  activities,  and  I
                        encourage         all    our      students        to    utilize      the
                        opportunities provided to develop themselves into

                        well  rounded  professionals  in  the  field  of  their
                        choosing.

                         Curioso is a platform to bring together students
                         from  various  departments  to  participate  and
                         improve  their  command  over  the  English
                         language  while  inculcating  values  like  team

                         spirit,  leadership,  innovation  and  so  on.
                         Expressions,  the  annual  literary  magazine,
                         curated by the students of The Literary Club of
                         PTU is a celebration of boundless creativity and

                         intellectual  curiosity.  Within  these  pages,  I
                         embarked  upon  poignant  poetry  to  thought-
                         provoking  essays  challenging  the  status  quo,
                         each  piece  reflecting  diverse  perspectives  and

                         passions.


                         As I peruse Expressions, I find myself lost in the
                         rich  tapestry  of  creativity  woven  by  the

                         students.  Their  words  teleport  me  to  a  new
                         world, ignite my imagination, and leave me with
                         a  deeper  appreciation  for  the  beauty  and
                         complexity of the human experience.

             The  "Neverkusen"  curse  was                     Xabi      Alonso’s       career      as     a
             finally  broken,  replaced  by  a                 footballer  is  nothing  short  of
             sense of vindication. I could see                 brilliant.  He  has  been  a  part  of
             the      entire       stadium        being        world-famous  football  clubs  -
             invaded  by  Leverkusen  fans                     Real  Madrid,  Liverpool,  and

             In my opinion, Alonso as well as
             Leverkusen          should       not      be
             content  yet  with  their  current

             huge  possibility  of  converting
             this league win into a treble - by
             winning  the  Europa  League  as

                                                              him.      She     checked        the     other

           He  was  panicking.  The  train  was               Thus,  a  love  story  ended  before  it
           about  to  arrive  at  the  station.  And          even  began!  He  was  never  able  to

           He  saw  both  sides.  The  vehicles
           were coming, but were far away. He
           paused for a moment. Then, he ran
           as fast as he could to cross the road.
           He  didn't  care  over-running  the

           traffic light.


           Unfortunately,  he  only  saw  the

                                  The ending makes everything beautiful.
                                     Our lives seem beautiful in the end.
                                 There is nothing beyond our life journey.
                                      Eventually, our life has an ending.


                               Then why should we hesitate to live our own
                                                         lives?
                                  Don't worry about thinking who you are.
                             Don't worry about what others think about you.

                                          Live free; Live on your own.


                                 Don't close your wings and look at the sky.
                                 Don't just fold your hands and think about
                                                        flying.
                                        Seek yourself; Explore yourself
                                These will get you further on your journey.


                               Why should we feel we will be ridiculed if we
                                                  say something?
                                Why should we stand in silence with folded
                              arms and wonder if something could happen if
                                                     we do that?
                                Why should we be ashamed to live when life
                                                   ends in death?
                                 Enjoy yourself while you have the chance.


                               Every step you take on your journey is a path

                                                 towards the end.
                                      So, know your flaws, love yourself,
                                            Love others like yourself
                                           Just spread love and peace.
                                 Because we should not regret that we hate
                                       others at the end of our journey.

                                      A dazzling emotion fills me softly,
                                               I’ll convey the name

                                  In shadows' tender, muted dance, I find,
                                   A melting candle, in solitude confined,
                                        Its waxen tears of amber grace,
                              Mingle with the night in an intimate embrace.



                                    Beneath the moon's soft, silken glow,
                                       It weeps and sighs, a silent woe,
                                   A solitary sentinel in the darkest hour,
                                   A testimony to time's relentless power.


                              The flame that once burned fierce and bright,
                                Now flickers gently, surrendering its fight,
                                  Yet, in its demise, a beauty does unfold,
                                      A story of life's mysteries, untold.


                                Each droplet that cascades like liquid gold,
                                       Whispers secrets of tales untold,
                                  Of love and longing, of hopes and fears,
                                  As it surrenders to the passage of years.


                                  The room is bathed in a soft, warm hue,
                                     As the candle's essence bids adieu,
                                    A testament to life's transient grace,

                                In the quiet surrender of this sacred space.


                                 So, in this melting candle's tender plight,
                                  I find a reflection of life's fleeting light,
                                  A reminder to cherish each passing day,
                                      Before it too, like wax, melts away.

                                                       parents,

                      I wish to be in a world, where people say “Nothing is more
                                             important than talent”.


                         I wish to be in a world, where people enjoy the taste of
                                                      freedom,
                          I wish to be in a world, where I’m the king of my own
                                                      kingdom.


                            I wish to be in a world, where fish race with a fish,
                           I wish to be in a world, where I make my own dish.


                       I wish to be in a world, where people won’t bother about
                                                        other’s
                                                      thoughts,

                              I wish to be in a world where talent means a lot


                       I wish to be in a world, where I’m not pushed into flocks,
                           I wish to be in a world, where no doors have locks.


                       I wish to be in a world, where bubbles wouldn’t lock dark
                                                        shades,
                          I’ve been waiting for this kind of world for decades.
