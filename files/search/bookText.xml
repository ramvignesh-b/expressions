         A NOTE FROM THE CONVENOR









            In these times when covid-19  has unsettled our personal and professional


            lives, we live in the midst of complexities and confusions. Faced with


            unprecedented challenges, we are forced to embrace paradoxes, twists,

            uncertainties and insecurities. At this juncture, we need to take recourse


            in our strong hopes, endeavouring to turn anxieties into anticipations,

            adversities into advantages and thereby grow with every new experience.



            Though delayed and deviated from the original plan of publishing as

            a hard copy, it is a pleasure to present, after a break of several years,


            the e- version of “Expressions”, a venture of the Literary Club of pec.


            “Stirring dull roots with Spring rain”, “Mixing memory and desire”,

            the lilacs that are bred symbolise renewal and confidence.

           On behalf of the editorial team of Expressions, I acknowledge with


           sincere gratitude the wholehearted support, encouragement and guidance


           received from our honourable Principal Prof. S Kothandaraman, in

           fulfilling this mission. We also express our immense gratitude to our


           Dean (Students) Prof. K Vivekanandan, for his constant support and

           motivation in the activities of the club. We place on record our thanks to


           Dr. Akila (Assistant Professor, CSE) and Dr. Rathinam (Assistant


           Professor, Mechanical), the faculty coordinators of the Literary Club,

           for their continuous support. Expressions would have remained a dream


           but for the creative contributions of our alumni, who have shared their


           valuable time and experiences. Thanks to all of them who gave form

           and matter to this concept. I express my heartfelt appreciation to the


           editor of Expressions, Mr. Najmu Sehar Wani and the designers Mr.


           RamVignesh and Mr. Rahul Perri for their committed involvement and

           meticulous hard work.



           “In the changing fortunes of time”, it is important to gather our spirits,

           unleash our creativity and strengthen our confidence. As Max Ehrmann


           wrote, we are children of the universe and “no less than the trees and the


           stars (we) have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to (us),

           no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore, be at peace with


           God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and


           aspirations, in the noisy confusions of life, keep peace in your soul. With

           all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be


           cheerful. Strive to be happy.” Wish you all the very best.
