Universities  serve  as  the  foundation  of  democracy,         and the success of democracy depends on the active        participation  by  the  populace.

The         conduct  of  varsity-level  competitions  on  various         topics is an indicator of the thriving level of discourse         among students.

If you can make that                                            happen,  you  can  make  anything  happen.”  The                                            literary  club  of  PTU  aims  to  help  the  student                                            community,  cultivate  this  belief  in  oneself  and                                           develop an attitude of resilience and perseverance. It                                            is always a hard challenge to sustain one’s level of                                            motivation  and  hence  it  is  important  to  constantly             Dr. Shanthi Simon             feed this inner power with the fire of ambition and                 professor hss              desire - an eagerness and a passion to follow one’s        dreams. It is nothing unusual for this spark to die down but the strength to         push one’s dreams forward is what matters.         The  free  expression  of  ideas  stimulates  intense  imagination  and  thinking.         Creative pursuits provide the necessary impetus to keep one’s faculties sharp        while  inculcating  the  powers  of  reasoning  and  inquisitiveness.  It  is  a         wonderful experience to delve into the depths of fantasy and reality. This can         be more exhilarating if, in this process, we keep exploring and analysing the         unfathomable depths of our own selves and also start appreciating goodness        in others. Hence it is highly important to have a space to meet, to read, to         discuss and to write, a platform to share insights on the diverse facets of life         gained  through  eclectic  experiences.  A  responsible  fraternity  of  creative,        thoughtful,  compassionate,  individuals  who  can  respond  constructively  to         inequity and disparity with a deep sense of cooperation, has always been the         club’s priority.                                                                              4","We  keep  striving  to  achieve  our  goals  and  raising  benchmarks  thereby        ensuring the uncompromising standards of quality in every thing that we do.        Peclectics,  MUN  Society  and  the  Theatre  division  stand  testimony  to  the        multifarious pursuits that have been included under the banner of this club.        A  sense  of  individual  belongingness  and  a  feeling  of  oneness  among  all       those who are involved with the club fortify the ethos of the club, “We are        what we repeatedly do.  Excellence then, is not an art but a habit”. Being a        part of this family has always given me joy unbounded, memories etched for        a lifetime. The openness to be inclusive and to accept the unfamiliar are very        crucial for personal and organizational growth. I am sure that the Literary        Club  through  the  numerous  openings  that  it  provides  for  the  student       community  of  PTU  will  soar  greater  heights  in  the  years  to  come.  The        maturity  to  embrace  change  is  coupled  with  a  determination  to  explore        untrodden  paths  will  definitely  keep  everyone  motivated  to  move  forward        with vigour.

As freshmen joining this college, we were a group of people enamoured by          this club and its agenda. We have all had that hesitation to let our truth be          spoken. It is here where we learnt that to break free from such a notion,         feels like breaking away from a prison of our own inhibition. And, as we’ve          come to discover, to find a community who jointly feel the very same, is          truly a privilege!         This  year,  we  find  ourselves  in  a  position  of  an  acute  and  unique          responsibility.  We  find  that  we  can  join  hands  with  such  like  minded          people in our very own institution, and publish an issue that speaks their          truth,  and  hence,  in  culmination,  we  find  ourselves  with  a  collection  of         remarkable thoughts and ideas.          As  you  flip  through  these  pages,  each  crafted  carefully  with  artistic          precision, you would comprehend the variety of thoughts in our peers! We          would also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who put their         ideas forward to be published in this remarkable edition of Expressions!

Rise of         Digital camera removed human need to develop photocopies, rise of smart         phone apps such Airbnb removed need of hotel booking operators. This trend        is nothing new, yet there is a big difference between what has happened in         last  2  decades  in  tech  world  and  what’s  happening  now  (Rise  of  AI  based         LLM technology such as ChatGPT). Usually rise of an technical invention or         an  advancement  will  disrupt  one  or  some  handful  set  of  Industries  being        impacted directly (Eg : Middlemen service impacted         with rise of digital Apps) , but with rise of Artificial         general intelligence , disruption is bound to         happen in almost every consumer based service         industry such as retail, education, healthcare, banking          and many more. For example, with ChatGPT it has         become possible for a high school student to research        on a science topic and even publish a book based on it.                                                                    10","C                                  ?                     h                 s                i                       a            h            a              t                         t                              T                            P                          G        W       What is ChatGPT ?       ChatGPT is a form of generative AI. A tool that lets users enter prompts to       receive humanlike images, text or videos that are created by AI. ChatGPT is       like an automated chat service found on customer service websites, as people       can  ask  questions  or  request  clarification  to  ChatGPT's  replies.  The  GPT       stands  for  \"Generative  Pre-trained  Transformer,\"  which  refers  to  how       ChatGPT  uses  specialized  algorithms  to  process  requests  and  formulates       responses. ChatGPT is only the tip of an iceberg buried under the ocean of       Artificial  general  intelligence.  Already  GPT-4  version  has  been  launched       which could accept multimodal prompts in forms of videos and pictures and       research are underway for GPT-5 which is aspired to have very minimal and        intangible features from any human intelligence.

For  an  engineering  student,  impact  would        largely depend on one’s long-term vision on his/her career and the attitude       they perceive towards AI. Career roadmap for any discipline they choose is no        more narrow structured and bound by dependencies on person, location and        affordability.  For  example  in  building  and  construction  industry  use  of        AI(Smart Construction) has created new paradigm in areas of planning, risk       assessment, quality control there by opening new doors of skill development        for those choosing civil engineering. Great positive aspect having new career        opportunities  enable  students  to  dream  big,  reshape  their  skills  and  equip        themselves to  venture new innovations. Yet, the scale of AI being developed       and launched to market is so fast for the world and its future generations to        digest.                                                                     11","This has created intimidation globally especially in academic sector.

As an engineering student, it is essential to equip themself with the right        skills and knowledge to succeed in this field. Here are some tips on how they         can prepare themself for the future of AI.         Develop Strong Fundamentals: The foundation of any engineering discipline        is  strong  fundamentals.  Students  should  have  a  good  grasp  of  the  core         concepts  in  the  discipline  they  choose  such  as  electrical,  electronics,         computer science, mathematics, and statistics. These are the building blocks        of AI and machine learning algorithms.         Gain  Practical  Experience:  Classroom  learning  is  essential,  but  practical         experience  is  invaluable.  Participating  in  hackathons,  internships,  and         industry  projects  to  gain  hands-on  experience  with  real-world  problems        would be of great value. This experience will help students understand the         challenges and limitations of AI and build your problem-solving skills.           Stay Up-to-Date: The field of AI is rapidly evolving, and new technologies        and techniques are being developed regularly. No industry would be spared         from  disruption.  Its  wise  to  be  updated  with  the  latest  trends  and         developments  by  reading  research  papers,  attending  conferences,  and         joining online forums and communities.                                                                       12","Learn  to  Collaborate:  AI  projects  often  involve  cross-functional  teams  with        diverse  skills  and  backgrounds.  Learn  to  collaborate  effectively  with  data       scientists,  software  developers,  and  business  analysts  working  in  real  time        industry problems. Communication skills and the ability to work in a team are        essential for success in any engineering field.          Develop Critical Thinking: AI is not a silver bullet that can solve all problems.        It is essential to develop critical thinking skills to identify the right problems to       solve, design appropriate algorithms, and evaluate the results.           In  conclusion,  the  future  of  AI  offers  exciting  opportunities  for  engineering        students.  AI  can  be  the  friend  in  need  if  used  properly  to  shape  our  future       profession.

How can you change it?       When your dreams are vague its easy to rationalize little expectations all day       around and never get to the actual things you need to do to actually succeed.        Define  your  dreams  with  clarity  and  precision,  now  assess  what  skill  you        would need to make that dream a reality.

And most of the times that dream        would never have been our first       choice and it’s only part of our life        because we choose the skill first        and not the dream. Our actions should       be driven by our conscious choice and        drive but not just with the available        options. Just defining won’t magically manifest your        dreams, you gotta work for it. When you define your dream you don’t just       define what you want but you should also define what kind of person you        would  need  to  become  in  order  to  achieve  it  and  if  that  person  is  actually        appealing to you! Construct an environment around you that maintains your        discipline  needed  to  work  on  your  dream.  Never  rely  on  just  motivation,       because it’s like a tide. You never know if its gonna be high or low until very        late. Setup a framework for you to do the required things over and over until        your excellence in it stops becoming an act and starts becoming a habit.

Those who knew         the  ways  of  old  were  long  gone,    with degrees and        a treasure trove of memories of participating and conducting events for their         juniors. It came down to us to ensure that the rich history of the club was         renewed and passed on to the next generation of students, to keep the flag of         the  club  flying  high.    And  to  that  end,  we  feel  content  with  our  efforts  to        introduce the students of Puducherry Technological Universty to the events         of the Literary Club, to provide them with a platform to debate and discuss,         to  ponder  and  explore,  to  make  mistakes  and  learn  from  them  as  they        proceed with their academic and professional pursuits. All while having the         time of our lives behind the scenes.         With  the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee,  we  were  able  to  conduct        events  and  initiate  discussions,  guiding  and  mentoring  scores  of  students         who  took  the  first  step  towards  self-realisation  and  learnt  from  them.         Hindsight  gives  us  differenet  perspectives  to  actions  of  the  past,  and  the         perspectives now have smoothened out the rough edges and gave a portrait        of perfection.         Our time at the Literary Club was filled with adventure and jubilation, and         with the end of our final year, we realised what all our predecessors had at         the end of theirs, our journey with the Literary Club never ends!                                                                               17","The power of passion                If you know me, you would be aware that I am not        the type of person who is good at writing articles, so        please bear with me.       Let me begin with a verse from Kahlil Gibran.         “If you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better        that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the       temple and take alms of those who work with joy.             For if you bake the bread with indifference, you  bake a bitter                 Rasheed        bread that feeds but half man’s hunger”.                                            2019-23 cse                                                 These words truly resonated with me. Do what                                                 you love. You don’t have to be great at it. If you                                                are passionate about it, then the effort you put                                                 in  wouldn’t  feel  tedious.  It  will  be  an  amazing                                                 journey. One such passion for me was the play                                                staged in our college annually. Till date, the best                                                 part  of  my  college  life  was  the  time  I  spent                                                 rehearsing for it.                                                On  a  bright  day  in  my  first  year,  my  senior                                                 Karthik  called  me  into  the  language  lab  and                                                 introduced me to his junior Vicky, who played                                                 the lead role in the play staged the year before.                                                He informed me of an audition for the play “The                                                 Fools  of  Kulyenchikov”  scheduled  for  the                                                 following  day,  since  they  planned  to  include                                                 first  years  for  a  small  role.  Unfortunately  (or                                                perhaps fortunately), I had a lab, so when I went                                                 in after 4, they had already finished.                                                                  18","The roles they had reserved for the first years were already filled, so they asked        me to audition for the role “Leon Steponovitch Tolchinsky” the next day. Once       I was done with my audition was when I discovered I had auditioned for the        lead  role  and  to  my  own  surprise,  I  landed  the  role.  This  was  specially        surprising because I am the kind of person who was made fun of for being        expressionless and for having a robotic body language.       But that play, it gave me a chance to improve        myself. In those 4 months of practice and        interaction with the seniors, I didn’t just        make friends, I got a family. Sadly, due to the       infamous outbreak of the corona virus just        a week before the day of the play, we        couldn’t stage it. Even though I was       robbed of the joy of having performed it,        I will always cherish the time I spent there.        Two years later, with the help of Dr. Shanthi Simon ma’am        and the secretaries of club that academic year, Rahul A.P       and Melvino Roshan, I had the opportunity to recast and        direct the play for Curioso 2022. I feel immensely special        that I got the best cast and crew I could ever ask for. We        staged  the  play  “Fools  2.0  of  Kulyenchikov”  successfully  and  I  even  got  the       chance to invite my old directors onstage and thank them. The play and the        role  I  played;  “Leon  Steponovitch  Tolchinsky”  has  become  a  significant        milestone in my life. Therefore, I hope that in the forthcoming years, the play       will bring everyone a part of the same joy I was privileged to experience                                                                         19","Group Projects - Perspectives                Put  yourself  in  my  shoes.  The  idea  of  engaging  in        conversation instills a sense of dread in the minds       of  the  unversed  in  social  communication.  It’s  not        that I’m incapable of making conversation, and to        my chagrin, people always rush to that assumption.       It’s that sometimes, I genuinely don’t want to. It is        baffling  that  people  tend  to  see  the  best  in  those        before them, which I feel is unwarranted at times.

Just pitch black, staring into the abyss,        immediately  plagued  by  a  myriad  of  thoughts.  The  dynamics  of  a  group  are        with various convolutions and the working ethics of each member vary greatly.       There is the one who ends up doing all the work, carrying the team over the        finish line. I don’t want the be the one…Not again. After a lot of complicated        calculations, I team up with three people with whom I feel confident. That is       until  the  work  begins.    As  time  goes  by,  doubt  creeps  in.  It’s  like  the  self-        awareness when you scroll though social media and stay on scrolling for nearly        two - three hours. A few important lessons to keep in mind while engaging in a       group project is, to ensure proper communication within the team. To each        their role is an essential concept without which there is a chance for absolute        pandemonium  to  reign.  The  main  goal  for  every  member  is  to  ensure  the        success of the project without too many disruptions. The other aspect is to       give credit where credit is due and hold people to what they commit.        The other aspect is to accept people’s limitations and help them along        to complete their part, not do their part for them. The individualities        of each member combine to form a new perspective. I implore every       student who is in the dilemma of completing your        project, let those perspectives shine.                                                             20","Silences                                                   “May 15 would be your last working day” As I heard                                           these  lines  the  world  beneath  me  started  to  fade                                            away, for a while my brain went numb as I tried to                                            process the zillions of memories that I had made in                                           the past 4 years in a new city with new people.                                            \"Friends\" is the one part of my university life that I                                            will  remember  for  the  rest  of  my  life.  I  met                Nikhil Sharma              thousands of people at that university, I must have                 2019-23 Mech              spoken with hundreds of them, and many of them         would be my so-called friends. But you know there are a few people that I met       who are really special to me, they understand me better than my family, know        me probably more than myself. But how do I define these people?  We have all        these people in our lives, while I speak of them, you might remember some       names in your mind. Is that who we spend the most time with? Is that where        we had the most fun? The ones we shared most of our secrets with? Are those        the people we've spoken to the most? I certainly believe not; these people       might fall into one or more of these categories        but this isn’t why they’re special to us. We all        value  conversations  a  lot,  the  people  we        generally spend our time talking with turn out       to be our favourite buddies, we believe that they        are the ones who’ll hold our back when we’re        down.  But  I  believe  that  the  best  of  friends  is        the  ones  who  can  enjoy  and  feel  the  silences       with  me,  that  one  person  who  need  not  hear        everything, who is not necessitous of words to        understand me. As the leaves need not talk with the roots and bees don’t have       to speak to the petals but they still share a bond and one that makes their        lives much more beautiful.                                                                21","The times when we can talk and share everything are the easiest ones to tackle,      the times when we are so overwhelmed that our tongue curls, our words fall       short, and our emotions zip our lips are the times when we require someone to       just look at us and know our emotions through any façade. These are the people       who know us better than anyone else, these are the people who have seen our      souls bare and they understand what we think, what we believe and what we do.       We remember the conversations we had and the words that were spoken, but       these words alienate people and sometimes bring them together in very unlikely      ways.  Words  communicate,  but  do  they  have  that  much  importance?  Do  we       really have a relationship                                            because of the words we       said, but I remember a                                                       hundred  people walking      away because of something                                         they said to each other.

When no conversation is forced and the fragrances of their      individuality  are  blended  together  then  what  comes  out  of  it  is  a  connection       that is beyond any language, any boundary and is purely out of understanding.       Such  connections  make  us  who  we  are,  be  it  our  mother  who  heard  us  even      when we couldn’t talk, be it our father who never needed a word to understand       our needs, be it our teachers who understood our fears and barriers without a       letter to them or be it our friends who understand our actions and reactions to      anything without huge explanations.       These are ‘the yellow people’ in our lives and it's just for them that we're willing       to go through hell with a smile. So, as I walk down the aisle of adulthood, I say ‘I       do’ to them and cherish these few people gifted to me.      \"Words may find us a friend but silences can find us a family\"                                                               22","The First Love                           Understanding the Importance of Self-Love for a Fulfilling Life                                            When  I  first  saw  her,  I  believed  she  would  be  the                                            most amazing person ever. Gazing at myself in the                                            mirror,  I  remarked:  “I  will  always  be  your  pillar  of                                            support, and together we will achieve great things in                                           life.”  Self-love  leads  to  acceptance.

When I was younger, it hurt me, and I even stopped dancing because I       didn't want it to happen anymore. Then, I asked myself, \"What do you enjoy        doing? Dancing, right? It makes you joyful. So, why do you want to quit doing it        because of something that isn’t under your control?\" I promptly returned to       my  dance  class,  and  ever  since  then,  I  can  proudly  state  that  I  am  a  skilled        dancer.

Inadequacy  and  self-doubt  may  result  from  this,        which  might  prevent  one  from  loving  oneself.  For  instance,  the  placement        process  I  went  through  was  challenging,  and  despite  receiving  offers  from       reputed  companies,  I  found  myself  dissatisfied  due  to  societal  and  peer        pressure. I blamed myself for being lazy in the        past, but I eventually realized that things will        unfold in their own time, and the job I accepted       chose me because they appreciated my personality.        Instead of dwelling on my perceived shortcomings,        I chose to embrace this newopportunity with gratitude       and acceptance.           To foster self-love, it's essential to recognize that your       unique qualities and experiences make you who you are.        Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your        own goals, values, and strengths. Celebrate your        accomplishments and embrace your imperfections, as       they are part of what makes you unique. Remember,        the only person you should be comparing yourself to is        the person you were yesterday.          Prioritizing yourself first is not selfish. Rather, it indicates that you are taking        better care of yourself in a way that allows you to do more for others. It's easy        to  become  concerned  with  what  other  people  think  of  you  or  what  society       deems  significant.  But  if  we  focus  on  ourselves  and  our  happiness,  we  will        realize that there are things in this world that are more important than what        other people think of us. Self-love entails treating oneself with kindness and       compassion.  This  involves  accepting  both  your  successes  as  well  as  your        shortcomings.                                                               24","Self-love  includes  prioritizing  physical  health  through  nourishing  food,        adequate rest, and mindfulness practices like meditation. These activities help        you  develop  a  healthy  connection  with  yourself  and  increase  your  sense  of       self-worth. Despite the fact that mental health is an issue that is frequently        covered, individuals need to understand that it is entirely  within   their  hands                                                                 to maintain their resilience when faced  with                                                         adversity.

You can calm your mind by taking a relaxing holiday.

And felt like the action of yours        had no purpose and there was no meaning in doing        that  but  still  you  did  it  and  pondering  with  the       question  of  why!  why?  why!?  and  which  leads  to        questioning of your very purpose of existence? It's a        question  that  has  perplexed  humanity  for  ages.        Some believe that there is a grand plan or meaning                                  Rajpradeep       to everything that happens, while others think that                                2019-23 Mech        it's  all  just  chaos  and  chance.  However,  there's  a  growing  belief  that  the        purpose of existence is simply for the experience. Everything that happens in       our lives, whether good or bad, has a purpose in shaping our experiences and        helping us gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.        Think about it - every experience you've had, every person you've met, every        challenge  you've  faced  has  contributed  to  who  you  are  today.  Even  the       difficult times and painful experiences can provide valuable lessons that help                                                 us  grow  and  evolve.  When  we  approach  life                                                  with an open mind and a willingness to learn,                                                  we can see that everything that happens has a                                                  purpose.                                                 For  example,  let's  say  you're  going  through  a                                                  difficult  breakup.  It's  painful,  it's  emotional,                                                  and it's challenging. But if you take a step back                                                  and look at the situation objectively, you may                                                 see  that  there  are  valuable  lessons  to  be                                                  learned. Perhaps you can learn to be more       resilient, more compassionate, or more independent. You may even come out        of the experience with a deeper appreciation for the people and relationships        that matter most to you.                                                               26","Let’s even say, you’re doing a bachelor degree programme in technology in a        university,  which  you  joined  due  to  your  parent’s  compulsion,  and  you  are       undergoing  a  very  difficult  time  there,  you’re  literally  suffocating.  but  just        when you take a step back, start to enjoying the little things around you, you        might even have the best four years of your life with a wonderful bunch of        F.R.I.E.N.D.S  which  you’d  cherish  for  a  life  time,  who  will  make  you       understand the real meaning of the phrase “Friends are more than family and        for a life time”        This concept is beautifully portrayed in the Marvel series \"Loki,\" which follows       the  story  of  the  mischievous  Asgardian  God  after  he  escapes  from  the        Avengers' custody in \"Avengers: Endgame.\" In the series, we see Loki forced to        confront his past and his actions as he is taken on a journey through space       and time. Through this journey, he gains a deeper understanding of himself        and the world around him.        Even the small, seemingly insignificant moments        in life can have a purpose. Maybe you strike up a       conversation with a stranger while walking down        the library road of your college, and it leads        to a new friendship or connection. Or maybe        you stumble upon a beautiful view while out       on a walk, and it brings a sense of peace        and joy to your day. These experiences may        seem small, but they can add up over time to shape       our overall outlook on life. So, how can        we embrace the purpose of our existence        as gaining experience? First, it's important to approach life with an open mind       and a willingness to learn. Even the most challenging experiences can provide        valuable lessons if we're willing to look for them.                                                                 27","Second, it's important to practice mindfulness and be present in the moment.       When  we're  fully  engaged  in  our  experiences,  we're  more  likely  to  see  the       purpose  and  value  in  them.  Finally,it's  important  to  remember  that  our      experiences are unique to us, and that we have the power to shape our own       journeys.  By  embracing  life's  challenges  and  opportunities,  we  can  gain  a       deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.       In conclusion, the purpose of existence is a complex and multifaceted concept.      However, the idea that everything happens for a reason and that the purpose       of our existence is for the experience is a compelling one. When we approach                                                                 life  with  an  open  mind  and  a                                                                willingness to learn, we can see that                                                                 everything  that  happens  has  a                                                                 purpose.

One of the loveliest connections we have in life is        friendship.  It  is  a  connection  we  make  with        someone  that  is  based  on  respect,  trust,  and       support. But there are instances when we may find        ourselves  treating  our  friends  as  an  option  rather        than  appreciating  their  presence  in  our  lives,  and        when  we  realize  this,  it  can  cause  us  to  feel  guilt       and regret.

When we think that our friends will        always  be  there  for  us,  we  start  to  occasionally  choose  someone  else  over       them. In addition, we often don't realize our mistakes until we have lost our        friends for good. We've all made this error at some point in our lives. Some        people may have lost their friends, while others may be working hard to win        them  back.  The  most  crucial  thing  is  to  admit  our  blunders,  become  more       aware of and grateful for the existence of those friends in our life, and make a        conscious effort to be a good friend in return.        True friendship is more crucial than ever in the fast-paced, socially connected                                                 albeit  virtually  and  psychologically  isolated                                                  world  of  today.

They  are  the  people  that        make you feel at home and who are there for you no matter where you are or       who  you  are.  As  a  result,  we  ought  to  treasure  and  cultivate  our  genuine        friendships and express our gratitude for the immeasurable gifts they bring        into our lives.                                                            29","“A cheat sheet to happiness”                                                    What is it, that makes life so appealing?

In this regard, I feel obliged to share with you, the most useful axioms, that I        have  found  to  be  quite  important  to  remember  throughout  these  days,        especially through college.        \"We are a part of nature, and 'a part' can never be bigger than the whole\" –        This might seem quite philosophical, yet it is also quite literal. No matter how       much we try to manipulate our surroundings and make decisions to change it        to be the way, we want it to be, there are matters we simply cannot control.        But in short, we must do our best and leave the rest. Your ambitions and hopes       may get fine-tuned based on your experiences, which is perfectly fine.         “Resisting temptations makes you stronger” –       One more fact to be aware of is that being nice always has its merits, there is        not one situation where acting rude will help you.        It  is  very  easy  to  be  rude  and  impolite.  Just  acting  on  your  wild  personal       impulses with no regard for the impression you may have on people, is very        easy. But what is hard, is being considerate and thoughtful. There is nothing        stronger and powerful than being able to get a hold of your own feelings and        behaving politely in any situation. It might be the professors, peers or juniors,       treating folks with respect makes you more powerful, regardless of your talent                                                                 30","“Love  is  amazing,  yet  its  definition  is  very  difficult  to  comprehend”  -  The        easiest yet the hardest feeling to comprehend during the young years is 'love'.        The  love  we  have  for  parents,  we  ignore,  while  the  attention  that  feels        refreshing,  we  cherish.  But  being  conscious  about  the  decisions  we  make,       whilst making sure, that this doesn't have an influence over it, is crucial. \"Our        parents  become  our  enemies,  strangers  our  favourite  people.\"  The  love  we        have for ourselves, helps us to undertake, what makes us happy and yet, we       may not ourselves know what the optimal choice is, in these cases it's best to        let the circumstances pave the way.         The love we experience is not the same, from different relationships. In simple        words, our parents love us regardless of who we are, a thief or a doctor the       love the parents show them will be quite the same.        But the love we receive from our friends, and even our        significant other’ will be solely based on \"who\" we are.       One, can never fill the void created by the other and this is        quite worthy to remember.        “Money does matter” - While money doesn't necessarily mean        success, it really is what helps us move through life. Right        from our tuition fee to our little allowances, saving it up       by controlling our random urges, to spend without care,        remains the best practice to learn. Being too cheap, might        sound bad, but I did realise that you can never be too cheap,       especially if you're in college.         “The only way to have fun is by doing the right things” - it's very       convenient to lose track of our time and progress, also even our        morality in this pursuit of pleasures. A hard willpower to remain        conscious, and act morally without an audience, adds to the self-respect we       have, and encourages to further try out new healthy alternatives.                                                                   31","“Being yourself is always the best” - While this may seem quite ordinary, this        remains the most important statement of them all.       This is also the hardest thing to achieve in this list of priorities to consider.        Everyone  remains  different  and  unique  in  terms  of  talent,  background,        knowledge and ambition. Studies show, that believing you really are secretly        the best, helps one achieve goals in higher rates.       What makes an individual happy is a question so complicated, that it can be        placed  close  to  the  question  \"what  is  the  purpose  of  life?\"  in  terms  of        complexity.       So, choose your pleasures wisely, and focus on long term commitments and        habits,  that  make  you  happy.  It  is  the  pursuit  of  happiness  that  makes  life       interesting and not the finish line.         “Friends and family are always the most valued possessions” - This one goes        without saying. Nobody that I have heard of, has ever said in their deathbed, \" I       would like to study one more chapter from the system design manual.\" It is        most probably going to be \"I wish my friends were here\", or \"I hope my family       stays happy.\"       Anything you may require in life, family and friends that you hold close to your       heart, will be able to provide you with it.          And  to  conclude,  these  are  a  few  things  one  can  possibly  realise  from  the        experiences,  one  might  have.  Also,  some  readers  might  find  a  few  of  these       statements, to be quite contrasting from their viewpoints, which is acceptable       and are also right in their own way, as, if people were to think exactly alike,        just the same as everyone else, then all the problems we currently have, would       disappear.          So,  what  have  we  learned  from  reading  through  this  article?  Absolutely       nothing, these are just a few key points to remember when you happen to go       through any of these situations, but the \"learning\" can be done, from within        alone.       Wishing you luck and hope you have an exciting journey of learning ahead.                                                               32","Audacity                                                   Given a chance, I would like to discover the intricate                                            details hidden within my very soul. A world that is                                            chaotic does not allow me to understand who I really                                            am and why my life evolves around those who might                                           not  even  know  my  name,  let  alone  my  demons.                                            Perhaps,  all  of  us  are  to  busy  in  embellishing                                            ourselves  in  the  way  that  might  be  pleasing  to  our                  s. jeevithaa             beholders,  which  includes  the  entire  population  of                    2020-24 it              this planet that the unmitigated dispositions are       crushed beneath. It would be such a blessing to just bring to our conscious        mind the minuscule but significant details that have contributed in building        up our character. However, most of us refuse to listen to what our soul literally        screams to convey. We suppress our desires for they        might lead to a wrong impression in the mind of         others. Happiness comes to those who have the         audacity to take a stand and make their souls       content byfollowing what it says. The opinion         of another person holds little importance and         life becomes brighter. Therefore, a piece of       friendly advice or rather a humble request. Explore         yourself, love yourself do not kill yourself somewhere        in the process of trying to be alive in else’s heart, believe        in yourself and most importantly, have the audacity to be your very own self.       Should you have that audacity, even your soul will refuse to let go of you.                                                                             33","All The Unsaid Things               We humans, the so called \"ultimate protectors\" of       the  planet,  are  assumed  so,  only  because  of  a        simple  advantage  over  all  the  other  species;        Language.  To  speak,  to  listen,  to  write,  to       understand,  to  analyze.  But  still,  there  are  times        when  we  choose  the  other  way  around  to  express        ourselves.  These  alternatives  at  times  make  more        sense  than  language.  Like  the  utmost  essence  of                           Harshal kariya       these unsaid alternatives is unsaid, an endless loop,                               2020-24  cse        maybe because of the unrealistic nature of the matter at hand. We seem to        communicate  all  of  the  generic,  average  things  with  words,  but  when        circumstances  are  extreme,  we  subconsciously  take  the  unsaid  route.  The       absolute  irony  of  these  two  very  famous  lines  is  wondrous  to  witness  -  \"        Actions speak louder than words\" and \"Think and speak. Once you utter                                 something,  it  can't  be  taken  back\",  shows  the  gravity  of                                 how  uncertain  language  and  thoughts  can  be  when                                merged  with  all  the  non-verbal  gestures.  Dangerously                                 uncertain indeed.                                                       I woke up to a dream the other day                                                       I thought I won’t forget it, no way                                                      The first person I saw that morning                                       I was just about to tell all of it, but I lost it even before starting                                           I completely forgot what had happened in the dream                                 All I remembered was what I had felt throughout with the first strike of                                                                    sun beam.                                                                       34","But come to find the beauty of unsaid things, it's mesmerizing. A wholesome        smile from a person in the crowd gives the confidence of survival among the       strange. That moment of you holding back tears, identified by someone, while        you are reluctant to have that petty eye-contact with them, but ultimately you        do and you don't regret it because now you know that someone has your back,        is nothing but love, and that too way above all its literal definitions. 'Speaking       with eyes', is the supreme topic for poets and romantics all over the world for        ages, but doesn't it deserve to be? Still, no literary piece is even close to what        that moment made you feel.                                      A habit I did develop in my childhood days                   I wouldn’t wake up at all. Alarms, noise, disturbances were all useless ways                                  I could only wake up to the most silent of methods               When my mom would kiss me tenderly on my eyelids with no exchange of words                                  Only then, would I know that the day awaits me;                                                 And my mom loves me.         Silence, the most versatile of the words that the world has ever seen, is only        versatile when expressed and not used in literary context. Silence in itself is a        very co-dependent concept with the situation. Every time one feels silence, its        motive will come out to be different, which is so not its dictionary meaning.       The humbleness, the love, the emotions, the grudge, the anger, the distress and        so  many  other  incomparable  expressions  can  be  expressed  and  understood        way more precisely than words can ever do. So, are unsaid things this intensely        powerful?  Even  more  than  the  most  dynamic  thing  that  has  ever  existed,       language? A question to be answered probably without words.                                                                            35","The Attire Verdict                The concept of a dress code in colleges might seem       like  a  very  good  idea  to  ensure  equality  among        students  but  it  is  very  misleading  in  the  global        south  where  the  dress  code  dictates  acceptable       outfits  and  is  enough  to  judge  the  conduct  of  a        person or character.        Dress  code  laws  were  first  introduced  in  the  year        1969  by  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  when  several                                  Nappinnai v       school students wore black armbands to school in                                    2020-24  ece        protest against the Vietnam War. Hence dress code was implemented to limit        student  expression  so  that  it  may  not  interrupt  the  functioning  of  an        environment.         We could always notice that the dress codes in any       institution  strictly  adhere  to  traditional  clothing        and  have  less  acceptance  of  modern  trends.  The        dress  code  often  is  misused  to  pass  opinionated       comments  on  a  person's  character.  Even  though        dress codes affect every student irrespective of their        gender,  women  are  more  prone  to  it  due  to  the       existing socio-political conditions. Regressive dress        codes  lead  to  moral  policing  of  women  that  can        affect  an  individual  psychologically;  this  is        substantiated  by  the  reports  of  the  American       Psychological Association. This leads to tendencies        of self-blaming in cases of abuse.                                                                        36","The dress codes of institutions should be changed according to modern times       so  that  deep-rooted  oppression  against  women  can  be  addressed  at  least  to        some extent.          Women, despite wearing decent clothing are subjected to ridiculous questions        by officials in positions of power. Research paper on the relationship between        social power and sexual objectification by Beijing Normal University makes us       wonder  if  dress  code  unchecked  would  become  a  very  big  issue  that  might        affect a lot of individuals.           We cannot expect a rigid system built based on conditioning to be revamped       overnight. For something to change over time, the rulemaking committees in        an  institution  should  consist  of  people  who  are  ready  to  embrace  positive        improvements for the benefit the student community.                                                                                                         37","Why otaku culture is booming in india                                                     You  would’ve  witnessed  the  sudden  spike  in                                             number  of  Anime  watchers  in  India,  especially                                             during  the  quarantine  period.  One  may  wonder,                                            why  these  people  are  so  obsessed  with  cartoons?                                             (Please don’t call anime as cartoon in front of a die-                                             hard  anime  fan!),  what  makes  them  to  continue                                            watching  it?  I’d  try  to  answer  why,  as  simple  as                    Rishi s                 possible.                  2020-24  ch         Anime is simply a Japanese comic adaptation, known as Manga. Anime have         been popular around the world for a while now. There are animes that are         still running that were started way back in the 90s. Manga panels have their        peculiarity,  where  most  of  them  are  read  from  right  to  left.  There’s  more         manga than anime, this is because not every manga is commercially viable to         animate. It is a really tedious job to animate a manga series, and anime fans         knows why. Each and every detail which is getting animated plays a major        role in storytelling.         The world of anime is the entire embodiment of        imagination,  anything  and  everything  which  a        human brain can imagine can be a story. Live       action movies and series cannot reach the level        of  attention  to  detail.  The  Japanese  are  really        good  at  drawing  and  imagination.  All  the        manga panels are hand drawn, yes you heard it       right,  every  single  stroke  was  from  a  Japanese        artist’s pen or a brush.                                                                     38","The  thing  with  live  action  adaptations  not  being  so  successful  is  that,  you        can’t  make  a  manga  accurate  scene  with  realistic  details.  Casting  actors  is       more tedious than animating, the character should be brought into life by the        actor.           Coming to the most important point, the stories that you read in manga or       you see in anime are really unique. Let’s take Naruto for example, it’s a story        of a boy with a monster sealed away within in him. The discrimination he        faced as an orphan with a powerful beast sleeping inside him made him to        really want to stand out. He wanted recognition, and he works hard to achieve       his  goal.  This  story  focusses  on  the  hardships  that  he  faces  in  during  the        course of time. The storytelling is so appealing, that it is hailed as one of the        best in the anime world.                                                               We’re in the conclusion now, and all I                                                              want to say is that, you can expect the                                                             most  impossible  story  to  exist  in                                                              anime  and  that’s  its  beauty.  If  you                                                              want to get into the anime world, grab                                                              something  short  and  exciting.  I                                                             suggest  you  start  with  death  note                                                              (read or watch yourself, I’m not going                                                              to spoil the story).

During these few years        of life, I tried to observe her range of qualities, from as simple as waking up at        a  fixed  time  to  complex  time  management  during  the  rush  month  of       festivities. Some of her qualities that make me admire her include discipline        or  a  routine  approach  to  everyday  hustle,  management  of  time  and  people,        and  her  impeccable  understanding  of  human  emotions.  These  qualities  are        very important for me, not just as a student but for my aspiration to become a       better person. First of all, her disciplined sleeping and waking time made me        realize the importance of habits and then I truly realised how habits shape        life. Secondly, my mother is unarguably the busiest person in the house. Still,       she manages to not only go through all her tasks seamlessly but also with the        utmost delicacy and precision. This is something I struggle with in my daily        life. Lastly, of all the qualities, my mother's emotional maturity is something I       admire the most. She handles every situation and every person with diligence.        She takes into consideration the feelings and emotions of other people also,        while being not only strong but vulnerable at times.        She inspires me to be a better person, not only with her words but with her       actions  also.  Whenever  I  am  battling  with  the  highs  and  lows  of  this        competitive academic life, I often find myself repeating her words \"Kuch naa        ban sako to koi baat nahi lekin achha insaan ban jana\" (It is okay if you will        not succeed in the academic career but try to be a good person).                                                              43","Breaking Bad                                                The Journey from Good to Evil          Rise of Walter White        R i s e   o f   W a l t e r   W h i t e        Walter White is an enthusiastic and devoted high         school chemistry teacher who has been diagnosed         with  Stage  3  lung  cancer.

T h e   L e g a c y   o f   B r e a k i n g   B a d .        Breaking  Bad  has  achieved  an  outstanding  reputation  and  is  widely         recognized as one of the most acclaimed television series ever created. It has         been  highly  praised  for  its  compelling  realism,  engaging  characters,  and        thought-provoking themes.         This program has achieved remarkable acclaim, leaving an undeniable mark         on  popular  culture  that  will  be  remembered  for  generations  to  come.  Its        influence can be seen in the countless television shows and movies that have         followed in its wake, solidifying Breaking Bad's place in history.                                                                             45","The Social Chameleon                                               My Life as a Nomadic Outsider            Have  you  ever  encountered  an  individual  who        fades into the background, whose presence easily         slips away amidst the sea of people? That person         was  me,  the  one  who  never  quite  found  their        place,  the  one  who  felt  like  an  outsider  in  every         situation.  My  life  has  been  marked  by  constant         movement and relocation, with me being the new                               Sudhanshu upadhyay         kid in school more times than I care to count.                                     2020-24 ece         Throughout  my  formative  years,  I  attended  a  dozen  different  institutions,         each located in a different city and scattered all over the country. My father's         profession mandated these transfers, giving me little control over my own        life. Just as I started to build friendships and establish a sense of belonging,         the harsh reality of displacement would set in, and I would be uprooted yet         again.        This nomadic lifestyle has left me grappling with a question that constantly         occupies  my  thoughts:  do  our  surroundings  shape  us,  or  do  we  shape         ourselves  based  on  the  patterns  that  we  encounter?  As  I  ponder  my  life's        trajectory,  I  can't  help  but  wonder  if  my  tendency  for  seeking  out  new         activities  and  experiences  stems  from  genuine  curiosity  or  a  subconscious         desire to be remembered and leave a lasting impression. This tendency has         influenced me greatly and became a reason for me to connect with everyone        around me as soon as possible, or risk being left out.         While  I  have  undoubtedly  benefited  from  the         countless  lessons  I've  learnt  through  my         constant  movement  and  relocation,  I  must        acknowledge  that  my  eagerness  to  establish         connections  with  those  around  me  has         occasionally bordered on being intrusive.                                                              46","In my attempts to connect with people, I've become a \"social chameleon\" of        sorts, adapting my interests and opinions to suit those of my companions,         much like a social butterfly.As a result, I've become a jack of all trades when         it  comes  to  friendships  -  capable  of  holding  a  conversation  on  nearly  any         topic, but a master of none.        As I reflect on these experiences, I am reminded of the saying \"less is more.\"         While  my  desire  to  connect  with  everyone  around  me  is  with  good         intentions, I must remind myself that quality is often more important than        quantity. In my efforts to befriend everyone, I risk diluting the meaningful         connections I've made along the way. It is a constant balancing act, but one         that I am determined to master as I continue to navigate the ever-changing        sea of relationships in my life.         Despite  this,  the  final  form  that  I  have  taken  is  not  without  its  share  of         missteps and errors. One incident that comes to mind occurred during the         11th  standard  when  my  closest  friend  and  I  switched  academic  streams.  It        was almost an automatic response for me to cut off all ties after 2-3 years,         and  so  I  decided  to  ghost  him.  At  the  time,  I  didn't  even  feel  remorseful         about  it.  It  wasn't  until  later,  after  finishing  my  12th  standard,  that  I  was         about  to  repeat  this  pattern  of  breaking  off  connections,  but  the  best        friendship  I  had  was  during  that  time.  Furthermore,  social  media  has         connected everyone, making it harder to let go of friendships. This was when         I realized that my life's patterns had conditioned me to feel uncomfortable        when I didn't sever ties after 3-4 years.         It's easy to wonder what might have been, to imagine how different my life         might have turned out had I experienced different things or lived in different         places.  But  in  the  end,  it's  the  unique  collection  of  experiences  that  have        shaped me into the person I am today, for better or for worse. So I embrace         the memories of all those schools and all those faces, for they have helped         me become who I am, the person who never quite fits in, but who is always         ready for the next adventure.                                                               47","Dreams                                                    On a very fine day, a woman around thirty years of                                             age  travels  in  her  office  car  which  moves  like                                             greased  lightning,  with  its  loud  siren  sound.  It                                             seems that the car rushes to some place which is in                                            dispute. When the car arrives                                             at the spot, she gets down                                             from the car and enquired                 Birundha m.s               about the problem there.                   2021-25 cse               An ear-splitting voice of a         15-year-old girl booms from the crowd. She came forward        and talked about the water scarcity crisis they have in their         village. She spoke about its consequences, how it affects         their day-to-day life and its impacts on people of different         age groups and genders. She finally concluded saying        “Amma! you have to do something for us. Help us to get rid         of this problem because it harshly hits the female population         of the society ,who are expected to look after the household         chores which is impossible without water. So, consider this and do        something amma.”         After listening to the girl, she has no words to speak out .Being filled with         wonder she stands still and admires her qualities.        After  recognizing  that  the  crowd  started  quarrelling  again,  she  raised  her         strong voice, which is capable of leading others and said:                     “Listen!  listen!  I  can  understand  your  feelings,  your  difficulties.  I  am        aware  that  this  a  constant  issue  which  has  been  persisting  for  years.  But,         believe  me.  I  have  already  spoken  about  this  problem  to  officials.  I  am         waiting  for  their  response.  Meanwhile  I  will  make  some  temporary         arrangements to reduce the impacts of this problem.                                                                 48","I  am  promising  you  to  provide  water  with  water  tankers  as  per  your        requirement. Believe me, now leave the place and get back to your homes, all         of you!”         The conversation continues nearly for an hour! As it is not an easy task to         persuade hundreds of people with mere promises. At last, she came to   grips                                               with   people’s   problem   by taking forward the issue.                                                 Then  she  makes  few steps to return back to her car.                                                But being preoccupied with the thoughts of the young                                              girl stopped her  from going  further. She stopped  and                                            looked  for  the   girl   hither  and thither.  The girl stood                                         beside her mother, with wide opened eyes which are filled                                       with dreams and aspirations.                                        The  girl  continued  staring  at  the   women   officer   with                                        amazement.                                       This  tempts  the  officer  to  ask  the  girl’s  name.  The girl                                    replied “Vasanthi” .The officer smiled and conveyed her best                                   wishes to the girl.                              Now she went back into the car. The car started moving forward,                            but her thoughts travelled backwards of 15 years. Then she was 15                   year old ambitious girl of a prestigious farmer.          WHY PRESTIGIOUS? – Prestigious because he belongs to the farming clan         which knows the power of mantra ‘HARD WORK’.         This  15  year  old  girl  have  several  great  dreams  of  serving  the  country  ,        sometimes  dreaming  of  ruling  the  country  ,  some  of  them  can  be  merely         daydreams…But EXCEPT ONE! Her dream of becoming an IAS OFFICER.         Suddenly distracted by the driver who asks,” Mam should I drive now to your        office or home? “She gets back to the real world and replies “go to home.”         After replying she started recalling the difficulties, she was supposed to face         in order to fulfil her dream.                                                                49","The  financially  unstable  situation  which  made  her  father  to  sell  the        farmland, her mother to mortgage her jewels.         The mental pressure after 2 attempts of failure. Her youth devoid of fun and       recreation. Sleepless nights and so on.          At  the  same  time,  she  wonders  on  her  parent’s  support,  her  own        perseverance and maturity        A  drop  of  water  fell  from  her  eyes  onto  her  hand.  The  car  stopped.  She       realized that she has arrived home. She wiped her tears and stepped out of        the car.         The voice of her mother with unconditional love and boundless happiness        welcomes her by saying “Vasanthi! My dear come inside and have lunch.”       She  smiled  and  said  to  herself  “VASANTHI  –  A  GIRL  OF  DREAMS  -NOW        AND THEN!”                                                                                                           50","Ghosts of the Past                                                     A peek into a gangster                                             “It’s been a long while, isn’t it? I suppose, 20 years”,                                           I recollected as I sat slowly in the chair facing the                                            serene sea. Once fast and steady hands were now                                            beginning  to  age.  Time  destroys  everything,  after                                           all.                                            Birds  were  flying  in  echelons,  a  beautiful  work  of                                            nature, indeed. But these moments are interspliced                  Nivesh .  S              with my past memories. I still remember, after my                   2021-25 ece              first shootout in the open, birds flew randomly,        with noises filling in the silent void, which seemed dead silent until I fired        my 9mm Glock.        It's been a while since I enjoyed something whole heartedly. It’s either my       past haunting, the future with its unpredictability or the present throwing in        random  surprises.  I’ve  always  known  that  I’m  alone,  but  now,  I  really  feel        loneliness. Left with no one to trust and the whole city turning their back on       me, I’m staring at the blank sea, with a lot of thoughts firing at me but able        to focus on nothing.        At  each  point  of  my  life,  I  won’t  lie,  “I  saw  a  choice.  A  choice  that  could       branch off into a different life. But I did what I did. Some would blame it on        circumstances, but it’s still me behind the wheels”. I still remember the day I        found a gun in the dark alley. And I couldn’t stand by doing nothing when        they were beating everyone. Most of the people wouldn’t have chosen to take       the gun and point it. But I did.        Years of repression came blasting through the barrels of the gun, and blood        sprouting out of one’s legs. The gunshot echoed through the walls as they        sprinted away.                                                                       51","I believe every bullet carries the name of its target. And, yes, I haven’t found        the one for me yet. I’ve dodged some, got hit by some, but I know when my        bullet comes for me.       We, humans, live and age within a blink of an eye, yet we’ve got our long        ever-growing  set  of  problems  overshadowing  the  sheer  beauty  of  the        universe. With aspirations to become great, we run in this battlefield, getting        hardened as the clock ticks. Why couldn’t it just be a green playfield with       bright sunshine, colourful butterflies. “It’s just our perspective. We see the        things  the  way  we  want  to”.  Our  mind  is  a  cute  little  jester,  isn’t  it?    The        uncertainty  of  life  indeed  spices  the  things  up.  Everything  happens  on  the        spur of the moment.       For the first time  in  life,                                                I really want to give it        all up. A life  filled   with                                                    betrayals,  hatred, and        violence.“I could feel the                                              darkness surrounding       me, engulfing me, down                                         the spiral of madness.        Maybe, I’m living in the                                                       darkness.   Or   am   I        Darkness      itself?”,                                                             I wondered.        Each time a thought of                                                     turning back passes by,       I get dragged back into this,                                        messier than before, with        no  turning  back.  Guess,  we’ve  got  to  live  with  the  choices  we  make.  The        Present is nothing but a series of consequences of the past.        I’m  here,  leaning  back  on  my  chair,  with  the  fleeting  moments  of  my  life       flashing before my eyes. With a troubled soul, aging body, nearing foes, I felt        it strongly than ever before. “It’s time to call quits.”        Suddenly, I heard a gunshot and a few people screaming. “I guess this one’s       for me”. I grasped the pistol in my holster.        As I turned back, he stood a few feet away, pointing his gun at my head.        “Ghosts of my past”, I chuckled.       BAM!                                                                52","Happy Ending                                         A traditional definition of a happy ending                                             Every  story  has  its  own  ending.  It’s  up  to  us  to                                           decide if it’s a happy ending or not.                                            A  happy  ending  is  when  the  main  protagonist                                            becomes  successful  in  what  they  do,  everything                                           goes according to his or her will, and they live a life                                            without  any  difficulties.  This  is  the  textbook                                            definition  of  a  happy  ending,  an  ending  we  all                Ludfin Morais              hoped to have.                   2021-25 ece               But right now, do any of us believe in a happy         ending, or is there even a happy ending...?         The answer is, yes, happy endings do exist, but they might not be similar to        their textbook definition. Life is a book with unlimited chapters. As we move         through each chapter, we are bombarded with a lot of twists and turns, some         of  which  make  us  happy  and  some  of  which  leave  us  completely         disappointed.        In  most  movies  and  books,  we  see  the           story  end  with  a  happy  ending,  but  if  we        take  a  deeper  dive  into  it,  we  realise         whether  it's  truly  the  end  of  the  story  or         just a chapter. Life is a rollercoaster with         many  ups  and  downs.  You  cannot  have        only happy moments. Remember, there is         joy and also sorrow; there is comfort and         also pain; and there is truth and also a lie.        It  almost  seems  as  if  all  of  them  are         interconnected  somehow.  You  can’t  have         one  without  the  other.  It’s  like  tossing  a         coin.  You  cannot  have  the  same  result        every time.                                                               53","For  example,  if  you  start  a  business  from  scratch  and  work  really  hard  to        establish it in the market, and finally, all your hard work pays off and you       become successful,        What is the probability that this success is going to last? We will never know        (mathematically  we  might,  though);  you  might  either  keep  climbing  the       ladder of success or you might just hit rock bottom. Life is just a series of        choices we make and the consequences we face because of them. So don’t be        afraid  to  make  those  choices.  There  will  be  people  who  will  try  to  dictate       your  life,  but  remember  that  it’s  your  life  and  your  story.  You  are  the        protagonist in it. Try to make the most of each chapter. Every chapter of life        will  teach  you  a  lesson.  Don’t  be  too  focused  on  the  ending,  because  the        journey is more important than that.                                                                                                             54","Gratitude                                                  The Key to a Positive Life         In a world filled with ego, negativity and jealousy, it        can  be  difficult  to  remain  happy  and  positive.       However,  the  simple  act  of  gratitude  can  help        overcome  these  challenges  and  lead  to  a  more        fulfilling life. Recently, I completed a book named        “Life's  Amazing  Secrets  sculpted  by  Gaur  Gopal       Das”. Now, I am here to share the amazing secrets        that I gained from it. So let’s move through...!                                 Shaanthapriyan                                                                                           2021-25 ece        Gaur Gopal Das, author of \"Life's Amazing Secrets,\" explains, gratitude is the        key to staying positive and focused on the good in life.        While problems are inevitable in life, it's important to pause and reflect on       the positives that come with them. By doing so, we can free our minds from        negative energy and focus on what truly matters. Das illustrates this with a        story,  comparing  our  mind  to  the  tongue  that  often  gravitates  towards       negativity  (to  some  food  stuffs  stuck  in  between  our  teeth).  Instead,  he        encourages us to focus on the other \"seed-free\" areas of life and the simple        joys they bring. There are 31 more teeth to enjoy, right!                                                             Gratitude  can  be  expressed  in  many                                                              ways,  from  being  thankful  for  the                                                              people  who  have  helped  us  through                                                              hard  times  to  appreciating  the                                                             inanimate things that bring us joy. It's                                                              also  important  to  practice  gratitude                                                              for  no  particular  reason,  simply  by                                                              being kind and helping others with a                                                             smile.                                                                    55","Incorporating  gratitude  into  our  daily  lives  can  be  a  powerful  tool  for        achieving  a  positive  mindset.  One  effective  practice  is  to  write  down  the       things that bring us happiness and positivity each day, no matter how small.        By  doing  so,  we  become  more  mindful  of  the  good  things  in  life  and  can        appreciate them more fully.        To  sum  up,  I  personally  believe  that  “GRATITUDE”  is  an  essential       component of a fulfilling life. By cultivating the mindset of gratitude, we can        overcome  negativity  and  find  joy  in  the  simple  things.  So  let  us  take  time        each day to be grateful for the people and things that bring us happiness and        positivity, and strive to spread that gratitude to those around us.       And once again a great “Thanks” for giving a chance to share this with my        friends!

The future is always fascinating.

Let me start with the recent trend of the famous OpenAI-built ChatGPT AI        bot.  What  is  claimed  to  be  a  game  changer  in  the  field  of  AI  is  slowly        degrading  the  human  potential  to  think,  make  decisive  choices,  solve       problems, and gain other insights. Homework and assignments are just one        click away. This is particularly worrisome when we think about its impact on        younger generations. The very essence of learning is destroyed. With the       increasing         world       population          and      concurrently        increasing unemployment and layoffs, more than 70%        of  humanity  is  struggling  to  make  a  living.  The       introduction of AI bots like these has already replaced        the human labor force in some industries. As of now,        ChatGPT  is  an  offline  tool  that  uses  local  cloud  data,        and everything is already preloaded up to 2021. It uses       the  internet  just  to  load  this  data  from  the  already-        available cloud server. The work of AI is already mind-        blowing.  Imagine  it  with  the  latest  knowledge        connected to the internet. With the development of the       complete  version,  more  and  more  robots  and  AI  will        replace humans, leading to a slow but sure disaster.                                                               57","In  a  world  filled  with  ego,  negativity  and  jealousy,  it  can  be  difficult  to          remain happy and positive. However, the simple act of gratitude can help         overcome  these  challenges  and  lead  to  a  more  fulfilling  life.  Recently,  I          completed a book named “Life's Amazing Secrets sculpted by Gaur Gopal          Das”. Now, I am here to share the amazing secrets that I gained from it. So         let’s move through...!          The  future  is  certainly  scary  and  disastrous  when  we  think  about  more          complex  and  advanced  enhancement  technologies  that  claim  to  be          revolutionary.  With  the  rising  levels  of  semiconductor  usage  and  ore         availability in the future, manufacturing computer chips will become way          more  feasible  and  cheaper.  The  price  of  computer  chips  will  fall  so          drastically that at one point it will be less than a rupee. That's cheaper than          garbage or scraps. Anything and everything will consist of chips.         Glass  chips  on  spectacles  or  contact  lenses  will  be  used  with  AI  for          identifying, analyzing, and, most importantly, generating information about          the things we see through our eyes, instantly making a window viewport.         Technology with the help of IoT can gather information with the blinking of          the human eye. The first users of this technology will undoubtedly be high                                                             school  and  college  students  who  are                                                            writing  examinations.

In  the  name  of  connecting  people,  we  are  more         attached  to  our  virtual  world  and  avatar  and  fail  to  make  efficient          connections  and  communications  in  the  real  world.  Two  people  chatting          spontaneously  without  breaking  the  conversation  for  even  30  seconds  on         the internet are unable and shy to even see each other's faces. In the name          of connecting people virtually, it has actually divided people in reality. This          leads to a lack of confidence and self-esteem. A more introverted approach          and unsociable behavior are triggered. The induction of brain chips is not         very far away in the human technology revolution. This technology can now          save  more  than  just  binary  0s  and  1s.  We  will  now  be  able  to  save  the          emotions, feelings, and, more importantly, the memories of a person's life          through the brain itself. It will now be possible to relive the past with the         same  feelings  and  emotions  as  that  situation.  While  this  may  seem          interesting  and  advantageous,  emotion  control  capability  and  emotional          intelligence  in  human  beings  drop.  \"Living  the  moment\"  will  be  a  big         question mark as the world will have already become more competitive and          challenging,  and  escaping  from  reality  through  these  chips  will  be  the          never-ending choice for these young minds.         Computer  chips,  with  the  help  of  artificial  intelligence,  will  literally  take          over the world. From driving your vehicle to executing your office job, robot          automation will become inevitable. There will come a stage in the coming          generations where there will be nothing that can't be done by a robot or an         AI.  The  requirements  of  man  have  diminished.  Robots,  AI,  and  future          technology will become so powerful and self-sustaining that eventually even          the very purpose of humanity's existence in the world will be questioned.          Technology  through  AI  will  analyze  serious  human  mistakes,  man-made         disasters,  mass  genocide,  illnesses,  sufferings,  terrorism,  and  threats  of          national integration, making us well aware of humans and their uselessness          in the advancing world.                                                              59","Technology and AI's decision-making mechanism will be such that they will         take global control of the world, claiming the infamous title from its very          own  creators:  the  humans.  Humans  will  become  slaves  to  their  own          creation, the machines. Ultimately, humanity will come to an end.            Human  civilizations  have  been  around  for  a  paltry  12,000  years—barely  a          few  seconds  on  the  geological  clock.  In  that  short  amount  of  time,  we’ve         managed to create quite a ruckus, etching our dominance over nature with          our  villages,  towns,  cities,  megacities,  and  technologies.  It's  time  that  we          react and respond to the mistakes made in the name of development and          technology and start making wise and future-proof decisions for the well-         being  and  survival  of  humanity.  That  doesn’t  mean  that  we  should          completely  refrain  from  these  emerging  technologies  that  make  our  lives          easier. We just have to be careful in the usage of these technologies and use          them only to achieve the desired outcomes for productivity rather than just         filling  the  pothole,  which  could  lead  to  a  catastrophe.  Humanity  must          always ensure that technology used in the name of development does not          degrade our existing position in the world and certainly should never give         technology a chance to take over control of humanity.                                                                                          60","Common Good in the age of hyper- individualism                For any civilization to prosper, the society should         be  put  forward  before  the  individual.  All  great          inventions and discoveries are products of service          to the society and not merely for the gratification         of  self.  But  today,  the  world  is  moving  towards          romanticism  of  hyper-individualism,  that  is  a          ‘private society’. It is indeed essential for man to         be individualistic, private and explore oneself. As          members of the human race, we tend to  have   our                              Shree varshan b          own pursuits or say ‘private life’ but one must not                               2022-26 cse         forget that, the life of one individual is immaterial.          Private individuals are not entitled egoist, all individuals do care about their          kith  and  kin,  but  their  intentions  do  not  extend  beyond  the  horizons  of         personal  interest.  The  human  mind  tends  to  prioritize  the  self  in  most          circumstances, but the human race is designed to be or best suited when it         works  as  a  community.  Any  rational  egoist  or  self-centered  personality          would  not  take  actions  in  capacity  of  common  good,  whereas  a  rational          public individual will prioritize common good, say ‘public life’.         Working for common good means – the members of a community facilitate          material or institutional needs to all members to attain a common goal. The         philosophy  of  common  good  is  to  bring  together  a  community,  with  a          rational obligation, so as to foster political awareness mainly, especially in a          democracy like India, where the State is indirectly controlled by the citizens.         But  the  individuals  in  public  life,  should  offer  a  genuine  commitment  to          matters of public interest. Here, individualist morality comes into play but          only at the cost of public interest.         Considering all parameters, the human race by virtue can mold itself into          any  desired  form  by  mere  actions  of  collectivism,  as  theory  of  evolution          suggests. Hence, it is essential for us to move from abstract ideas like hyper-         individualism to a more ethical and rational public work culture, so we can          provide the future citizens a better world.                                                              61","Broken Promises                                      The Tragic Tale of McNamara's Boys in Vietnam          The Vietnam War was one of the most divisive and        controversial  conflicts  in  American  history.  The         war  claimed  the  lives  of  over  58,000  Americans         and  countless  Vietnamese  civilians,  and  it  left  a        lasting impact on American society. But what many         people  do  not  know  is  that  the  US  government         deliberately  sent  thousands  of  mentally-disabled         men into combat during the Vietnam War.                                         Shivashish roy                                                                                           2022-26 ece        It was a dark chapter in American history that is often overlooked, but the         truth  is  that  during  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s,  the  US  military  relied         heavily  on  mentally-disabled  men  to  fill  its  ranks.  These  men  were  often         drafted into service without being properly screened or diagnosed, and they        were sent to fight in a war that they did not fully understand.         The  story  of  these  men  is  a  tragic  one,  filled  with        sorrow, suffering, and sacrifice. It is a story of how the         government  used  the  most  vulnerable  members  of         society  as  pawns  in  a  deadly  game  of  politics  and         power. And it is a story that deserves to be told.        One of the most compelling examples of this tragedy         is the case of Bobby Garwood. Garwood was a young         man  from  West  Virginia  who  was  drafted  into  the        Army  in  1965.  He  had  a  low  IQ  and  was  diagnosed         with  schizophrenia,  but  he  was  sent  to  Vietnam         anyway.         Garwood's experience in Vietnam was harrowing. He        was captured by the enemy in 1966 and spent the next         14 years as a prisoner of war. During his captivity, he was subjected to brutal        torture  and  abuse,  and  he  witnessed  the  deaths  of  many  of  his  fellow         prisoners.                                                             62","When  Garwood  was  finally  released  in  1981,  he  returned  to  the  United         States to find that he had been branded a traitor by his own government.          The military accused him of collaborating with the enemy and even court-          martialled him, despite the fact that he had been a prisoner of war for over         a decade.          Garwood's case is just one example of the many mentally disabled men who          were  sent  into  combat  during  the  Vietnam  War.  These  men  were  often         treated as expendable, disposable, and unworthy of the respect and dignity          that all human beings deserve.          The government's decision to use mentally disabled men as cannon fodder          in Vietnam was not an accident or a mistake. It was a deliberate policy that         was designed to fill the ranks of the military with as many warm bodies as          possible, regardless of their mental health or well-being.                                                          The story of these men is a reminder that                                                          war  is  not  just  a  political  or  military                                                         conflict,  but  a  human  tragedy.  It  is  a                                                          reminder that the decisions we make as a                                                          society can have profound consequences                                                         for the most vulnerable members of our                                                          community.

For  example,  putting  out  a        petition  to  the  chairperson  of  my  school  to  eradicate  cement  waste  and         poisonous materials finally became a request that never existed.

How could one person possibly save all the         precious savings in the world? Go find a better job to do! Money is life! \",        Well, as you can see, these were all the voices of the people who pushed me         down, stomped on my heart, and found many ways to just make me want to         get emotionally traumatized.         But I believed that the things that made me think different from others are        the things that could make me unique in a good way...         It takes a million sacrifices to get a rare gem. But I believe that the rare gems         that I got in my life were my dad, mom, and my chemistry teacher, Dr.Phani         Kumar Sir.

When  the  whole  world  judged  me,  these          diamonds, whom I considered my world, embraced me for being me and let          all the bad things just slide off.         They  trusted  my  passion  and  let  it  happen  slowly  without  any  pressure.          Dance  and  music  enabled  me  to  think  better,  helped  me  use  my          vulnerability  to  solve  real-life  problems,  and  helped  me  bear  all  the         hardships that Mother Earth faced in her everyday life.          Although things didn’t go as planned, the angels that God sent me in my          life  influenced  me  and  taught  me  that  if  I  love  something  so  much,  the          universe will find ways to bring me closer to the thing I love the most. The         \"Expressions\" of my story might not be extemporary like others, but I know          they are unique and ethereal, like my mother Earth.          Only God knows the journey that I will face henceforth, but I’d guess I will          end this essay with a sweet short poem.                                                      A LIFELESS WORLD                                            This world is painted with shades of blue,                                          Can never be joined with the shimmer of glue,                                                     It’s hard to say this,                                                          With no bliss,                                                   That humanity is sinking,                                                 Like how his socks are stinking;                                             I guess we don’t have nine lives like a cat,                                            Or can never sleep upside down like a bat,                                                       But we’re still at,                                               Living in this lifeless world of act.          I hate to make false lame slogans to protect mother Earth but instead love          performing the act and then declaring it to the public. So to all the beautiful          souls reading this essay to this very sentence,          I would request you just one thing. To play your part to reduce the damage         caused to the only home you are living in, that is MOTHER EARTH.                                                              65","66","Not always                                                                                   When you’re awake, dream!
